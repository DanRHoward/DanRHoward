### Hi there 👋

- 👨‍🎓 I'm a recent graduate of the [AI Core](https://www.theaicore.com/) Data Science programme.
- 📜 I've been trained to construct industry standard data pipelines, conduct data cleansing and EDA, create ML and neural networks for predictive modelling.
- 🐍 I've implemented these data science methods using python programming language.
- 👷 I'm currently working on an independent project which intends to using sentiment modelling to assess whether a given news article contains [fake news](https://github.com/DanRHoward/Fake_News_Detection_Model).
- 🏫 I've graduated from the [University of Chester](https://www1.chester.ac.uk/) with a *Distinction* in Mathematics MSc.
- 📖 I'm currently read *The Data Science Design Manual* by S.S. Skiena to expand my understanding of the data science field.
