### Hi there 👋

- 👨‍🎓 I'm a recent graduate of the [AI Core](https://www.theaicore.com/) Data Science programme.
- 📜 I've been trained to construct industry standard data pipelines, conduct data cleansing and EDA, create ML and neural networks for predictive modelling.
- 🐍 I've implemented these data science methods using python programming language.
- 👷 I'm  always looking for my next independent project. Some of these projects include: using sentiment analysis to model given news article text files to determine whether they contains [fake news](https://github.com/DanRHoward/Fake_News_Detection_Model) and an exploratory data analysis project using data gathered by [Yelp's API](https://github.com/DanRHoward/Yelp_London_EDA_Project).
- 🏫 I've graduated from the [University of Chester](https://www1.chester.ac.uk/) with a *Distinction* in Mathematics MSc.
- 🌱 I’m currently self-learning SQL and Power BI.
